# Node Task Manager with MangoDB(by Mongoose) or SQLiteDB(by Sequelize)

This project is a simple [task manager server](https://node-todos-with-db.onrender.com/) built with Node.js with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and DB implemented with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) or [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/). It includes [API documentation using Swagger](https://node-todos-with-db.onrender.com/api-docs/) and is configured to support TypeScript for development.

## Warning

**Note:** The hosting service where the server is deployed may run slowly. The first request, also known as a "cold start" may take up to 50 seconds.
